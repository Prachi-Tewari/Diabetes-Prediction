# Diabetes-Prediction
Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machine Model.
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.


**Overview:**
- The machine learning model is trained on a dataset containing various health indicators and corresponding diabetes labels. Through a process of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and utilizing the SVM algorithm, the model learns to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on their health attributes.


**Workflow:**
- Data Collection: Diabetes dataset containing relevant health parameters.

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for modeling.

- Train-Test Split: Partitioning the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

- Support Vector Machine Classifier: Utilizing SVM algorithm to build a predictive model.

- Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the SVM model using evaluation metrics.

- Prediction: Using the trained model to predict diabetes likelihood for new instances.


**Dataset:**
- The dataset used in this project contains anonymized health information of individuals, including features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc., along with a label indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
